# Least-Squares-MATLAB-Implementation
Recapitulation: in several real-life applications, the resulting system of linear equation 𝐴𝑥 = 𝑏 has no solution. According to the least square linear matrices solution, it is possible to ignore that by finding the  closest value of 𝑥 that makes 𝐴𝑥 as close as possible to 𝑏. That is the aim of this MATLAB implementation. 

The least-squares approach truly defines the solution for minimizing the sum of squares of 
deviations or errors in each equation's result. In data fitting, the least-squares method is frequently 
used. The best fit result is thought to lower the sum of squared errors, or residuals.
Least-squares problems are divided into two categories:
1. Ordinary or linear least squares 
2. Nonlinear least squares

The following implementation demonstrates that the code can be implemented in any valid matrices of a system of linear 
equation (SLE).
