# Least-Squares-MATLAB-Implementation
In several real-life applications, the resulting system of linear equation 𝐴𝑥 = 𝑏 has no solution.  According to the least square linear matrices solution, it is possible to ignore that by finding the  closest value of 𝑥 that makes 𝐴𝑥 as close as possible to 𝑏. That is the aim of this MATLAB implementation.
